Analyzes 'isset(...)' function usages.<br />
<br />
This inspection suggests using 'null !== ...', 'array_key_exists(..., ...)' instead.
In cases when isset is applied to array-accessing expressions, this inspection checks if concatenation is 
used to generate an index.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that array_key_exists returns true even if array item is null; this inspection
is focused on verifying data structures' sanity and may be safely ignored in some cases.<br />
<br />
Refactoring this might present a significant cost in terms of 
additional development and legacy code reverse engineering, so 
the cost-benefit should be weighed carefully.
