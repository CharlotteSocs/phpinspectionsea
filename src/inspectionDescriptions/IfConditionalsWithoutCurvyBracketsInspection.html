Analyses if conditionals (if/elseif/else) have no or empty bodies.<br />
<br />
Conditionals should usually have a body; a conditional that as no body is often 
caused by incomplete error handling code or indicative of bad design. <br />
Architects should decide whether this code should be refactored or removed.
