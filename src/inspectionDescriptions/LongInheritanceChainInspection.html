Analyses inheritance chain and report for 3+ inheritances.<br />
<br />
Analysis is not performed on test classes, which can introduce mocks violating the rule.
Exceptions are also no inspected, because it's domain specific how exceptions structured.<br />
<br />
Background for this inspection is prevent growing monstrous super-classes included shared code,
but rather force people looking into appropriate design patterns.
