Analyses if 'count(...)' calls applied to PropelCollection objects.
In general recommended logic is first to do count with query object and
only then to query data from database and construct a collection:

<pre>
    $objEntitiesQuery = EntityQuery::create()
        ->filterByAttribute('value');

    $intCountEntities = $objEntitiesQuery->count();
    if ($intCountEntities > 0) {
        $objEntitiesCollection = $objEntitiesQuery->find();

        /** operate on collection */
    }
</pre>
