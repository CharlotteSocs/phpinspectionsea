Analyses conditional constructions where the default value can be removed from the 'else' 
condition and placed prior to the conditional, which can simplify readability and ease of support.

<pre>
    if () {
        $var = [expression];
    }
    [elseif () { ... }]
    else {
        $var = [array|string|constant|number];
    }
