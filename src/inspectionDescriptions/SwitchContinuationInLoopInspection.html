Analyses continue usage in switch-case context. Due to PHP's 
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.continue.php">unusual continue syntax</a>, 
new users who are used to other languages might be confused by its behaviour.

Covers following case:

<pre>
    for (...) {
        switch(...) {
            case ...:
                continue; /* should read 'continue 2' to continue with the next iteration of the outer loop */
            ...
        }
    }
</pre>
