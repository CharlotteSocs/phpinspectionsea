Analyses foreach expression data source. It's expected to be an array, traversable object or string.
When analysis can not be performed (eg some methods are not annotated properly), additional
warning generated to resolve annotations issues.<br />
<br />
Risks free refactoring which mostly is properly annotating methods, but benefit is locating new bugs/dead code.
