From official documentation:

<blockquote>
    <b>Note:</b><br />
    For portability, it is strongly recommended that you always use the 'b' flag when opening files with fopen().
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b>Note:</b><br />
    Again, for portability, it is also strongly recommended that you re-write code that uses or relies upon
    the 't' mode so that it uses the correct line endings and 'b' mode instead.
