Analyzes if 'count(...)' is applied to PropelCollection objects.
In general, the recommended process is to perform a count
with the query object first, and only then to query data from a database
and construct a collection:

<pre>
    $objEntitiesQuery = EntityQuery::create()
        ->filterByAttribute('value');

    $intCountEntities = $objEntitiesQuery->count();
    if ($intCountEntities > 0) {
        $objEntitiesCollection = $objEntitiesQuery->find();

        /** operate on collection */
    }
</pre>
