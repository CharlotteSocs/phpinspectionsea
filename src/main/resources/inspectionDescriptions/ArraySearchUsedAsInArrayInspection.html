Reports if array_search(...) is used in the context of in_array(...).
<!-- tooltip end -->
array_search overhead is minor and lies in storing and returning index, which
is not used in case of in_array.<br />
Also reported cases are misleading and refactoring with in_array would clearer
express intention of code constructs.
