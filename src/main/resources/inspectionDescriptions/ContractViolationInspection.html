The inspection analyzes public classes' API with the implemented interfaces (contracts) and reports methods which are
not a part of the existing contracts (violating the contracts).<br/>
<br/>
Possible solutions:<br/>
- contract actualization (if you own it);<br/>
- new contract introduction (if you don't own the original contract);<br/>
- moving such methods into a trait (mixin-alike, smells but an option when dealing with badly designed packages);<br/>
