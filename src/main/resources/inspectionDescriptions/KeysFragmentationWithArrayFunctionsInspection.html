'array_filter(...)' preserves original keys set while skipping key-value pairs.<br />
E.g. [ 0 => null, 1 => '...', 2 => null ] after filtering null values becomes [ 1 => '...' ].<br />
<br />
We are reporting when implicit numeric index used for accessing such result and json-encoding applied
(the you can get hash-map instead of expected array).
