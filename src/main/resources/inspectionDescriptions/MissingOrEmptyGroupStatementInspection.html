Reports if conditionals (if/elseif/else) have no bodies or empty bodies.<br />
<br />
Conditionals should usually have a body; a conditional that has no body is often
caused by incomplete error handling or is an indicative of bad design. <br />
Architects should decide whether this code should be refactored or removed.
